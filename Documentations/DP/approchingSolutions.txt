Approching Solutions to dp problem is simply::
 1 :: Identify sub problems and solve them 
 2 :: Use subproblem Solutions to solve larger problem

Five steps to tackle dp ::
 1 :: Try to find a way to visualize example :: Helps to see connection and underlying pattern
 that may help to Identify subproblem :: Try visualize through a DAG if possible, often solution is some path to the DAG
 2:: Find an appropriate subproblem
 3:: Find relationships among subproblems
 4:: Generalize the relationships
 5:: Solve problem by solving subproblems in appropriate order

 ::: ::: ::: often solution approach is find DAG and Preorder then find path across the Preorder ::: ::: ::

 ::: No doubt that finding right subproblem  is the most challanging part

 :: Common subproblems
 1D subarray,
 1D subarray after some sorting
 2D , 2 index
 subarray from middle or edges

 :: Do not always bother on number of element count or size for dp , pay some attention on value range.

:: Do not always try to , some times try to solve in reverse order like choosing the last thing to do 
in stead of first
